Ok so lets see how the solution goes....

<h3>"The AAA.txt file"</h3>
The start is the [AAA.txt](https://github.com/Vsquare07/A858-write-up/blob/main/AAA.txt "hover text"), at first glance it is very annoying but if we count the number of As in each block of As and replace it with the number we get to see a clean bunch of these numbers : `112 97 115 116 101 98 105 110 46 99 111 109 47 107 75 84 120 103 122 70 110`

It is very intuitive to replace the numbers with their respect ASCII charachter and BOOM! we get a pastebin link that contains a [txt file](https://github.com/Vsquare07/A858-write-up/blob/main/Tujhe%20Dikh%20Nahi%20Raha%20Hai.txt "hover text")
This way the stage 1 is completed
